# StructureImports

__Version:__ 1.16+ (Tested and Confirmed working in 1.18+)

__Description:__

I made this to share across youtube in an attempt to simplify the process of importing structures between worlds without the use of a 3rd party software.

Rather than trying to learn new software or create your own minecraft pack, you can download mine and get straight into it.

Place your .mcstructure file into the 'Structures' folder, the load up minecraft. Attach the behaviour pack to your world and enter it.

Once in game, use the structure command to load in your structure.

__Example:__
```/structure load <Name of .mcstructure file> x y z 0_degrees none true true  ```
